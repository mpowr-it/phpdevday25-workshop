# Module Is Missing :(

_I'm sorry! Unfortunately the requested module from your exec-call is missing in this release. With the upcoming RC-2 version of release 1.0.0, all listed modules for devbox should be callable and functional as well. Check the current changelog for further information_

## Available Scripts (Active)

|--------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `init-pyenv` | Initialize a dedicated python3 environment (experimental feature)                 |
| `help`       | Print-out this markdown file using glow & bat to show available scripts + aliases |

```bash
# call devbox-linked script|action (e.g. devbox run help)
$ devbox run <script>
# you can use your devbox-run alias 'xr' as well (if defined in your terminal init-specs)
$ xr <script>
```
